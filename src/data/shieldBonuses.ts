  Buckler:
    'The buckler is a lightweight shield which relies more on parrying blows than outright stopping them. The buckler also has the added benefit of being rather small with almost no weight, allowing it to be held but not used while wielding two handed weapons. You receive no bonuses when doing this, but it means that if you do switch over to a one-handed weapon, you instantly get the buckler’s bonus.\n\nThis shield is gripped instead of being strapped in: it only takes 1 second to ready.',
  Clothe:
    "Clothe shields aren't official shields: they're improvised by wrapping a clothe (a tunic works or any M-sized piece of clothing or fabric works) around the wrist.\n\n",
  'Figure Eight':
    'This shield is designed specifically for phalanx or shield-wall tactics. This gives a +2 Parry and a Cover of +2 (+4) to anyone fighting on either side of you. This stacks with any Parry or Cover that they have from either their weapon or shields.\n\nThis shield is gripped instead of being strapped in: it only takes 2 seconds to ready.',
  Pavise:
    'This shield is less a shield and more portable cover employed by gunners and crossbowman, rather than fighters.\n\nHowever, the Pavise can be set up using a kick stand in the back, giving anyone crouching behind it basically complete cover and allowing that person the ability to steady their weapon on it.',
  Round:
    'With the Round Shield, on a natural roll of 20 on Defense or an Unarmed Strike, you delay your opponent’s next attack by 5 seconds.\n\nThis shield is gripped instead of being strapped in: it only takes 2 seconds to ready.',
